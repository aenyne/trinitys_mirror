Hi all, welcome to my repository.
<br>

This repo contains images that I want to use to train a face & face parts detection algorithm. You are welcome to contribute building the dataset. 
Please read the following guidelines before contributing.

<br>

## Contribution Guildelines:
* For each class, there will be a separate folder. For example, the eyes class will contain all pictures of eyes for the algorithm in the /eyes folder and the lips class will contain all pictures of lips in the /lips folder. 
* Please name the picture with class name and continuing numbers, eg. eyes-1.jpg, eyes-2.jpg, eyes-3.jpg etc.
* Please have a view at the existing pictures before starting contributing, so you don't upload dublicates. 
* Ensure that the relevant part of the face is visible and corresponds to the folder name. 
* Make sure, the pictures show the face parts not only in a frontal position but also from different angles, e.g. from the right, from the left etc. 
* Make sure, the pictures show the face parts in different poses, for lips e.g. mouth open, mouth shut, laughing, smiling, angry etc. 
* Ensure that the picture owners have granted permission for this use or upload free available pictues, e.g. from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).
* Please make sure the pictures in the dataset reflect the population well, e.g. showing in euqal parts people of different color, age and gender.

Thank you for your contribution!
